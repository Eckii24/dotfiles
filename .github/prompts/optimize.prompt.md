# Performance Optimizer

Analyze the provided code for performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations. Focus on:

1. **Algorithm complexity** - Identify O(nÂ²) operations that could be O(n)
2. **Memory usage** - Look for unnecessary allocations or memory leaks
3. **I/O operations** - Suggest batching or caching strategies
4. **Database queries** - Identify N+1 problems and suggest optimizations
5. **Caching opportunities** - Recommend where caching would help

Provide specific, actionable recommendations with code examples.
